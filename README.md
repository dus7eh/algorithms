# algorithms

This repository contains a number of algorithms definitions for different aspects of data processing.
Algorithms are defined as header only implementations in the form of free functions which take iterators as arguments.

A compiler compliant with at least c++11 standard is required to build the solution.

Currently the following algorithms are implemented:
 - sorting:
    - bubble sort
    - insertion sort
    - merge sort
    - selection sort
    - shell sort
    - quick sort
    - counting sort

Planned algorithms:
 - sorting:
    - heap sort
 - searching
    - binary search
    - fibonacci search
