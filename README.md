# algorithms

This repository contains a number of algorithms definitions for different aspects of data processing.

Algorithms are defined as header only implementations.
A compiler compliant with c++11 standard is required to build the solution.
Algorithms are prepared in the form of free functions which take iterators as arguments.

Currently the following algorithms are implemented:
 - sorting:
    - bubble
    - insertion
    - merge
    - selection
    - shell
 - searching
    - TBD
